# Emergencyvehicle

My project is on Emergency vehicles. I built this project using the sqlite3 module which comes with python, no need to install separately. Just run the emergencyvehicles.py to see the output of the code. 

Used modules.
â€¢	Import Sqlite3

	This code is for those in the service, such as security, firefighters, and other emergency responders. In the database file, the data entry person enters the data on the emergency vehicles and their locations. This emergency services will access the file in the time of emergency and can request the services according to the requirement and availability. If the vehicle is not available in their location, it will show the nearest available vehicle in the table. It will also allot the vehicle from the other location if the vehicle is unavailable in their location.
